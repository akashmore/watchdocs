Citizenship.
Citizenship is a legal relationship between a person and a country. Usually the country is the one he or she was born in, lives in, supports, and in return gets protection. A person is usually a citizen of the country where he or she is born, but sometimes a person will apply to change his or her citizenship to become a citizen in another country. There are countries which allow dual (two) citizenship, and countries which do not.
In most countries, citizens have civil rights such as being able to vote, and duties, such as keeping the laws. An important right is being able to come back to your country after you have left it for a while.
