Henry IV (13 December 1553 – 14 May 1610), "Henri-Quatre", was King of France from 1589 to 1610 and King of Navarre from 1572 to 1610. He was part of the Capetian dynasty and the first king of the Bourbon family in France. During his reign, he built the Grande Galerie onto the Louvre.
Life.
Henry IV was born in Pau. He was the son of Antoine de Bourbon and Jeanne of Navarre. On August 18, 1572, Henry married Margaret of Valois. She was the sister of Charles IX. He became the King of Navarre in the same year.
Henry's children were Louis XIII and Henrietta Maria of France, who married Charles I and became the Queen of England. He was a friend of Michel of Montaigne.
Henry was murdered by a fundamentalist Catholic on a street in Paris on May 14, 1610.
His reputation.
Henry IV is remembered as a good king who helped to stop religious wars. He changed his own religious beliefs several times. He was hated by some Catholics and Protestants who held strongly traditional views. He ruled for 17 years. He tried to make sure that poor people had enough to eat. Two beautiful landmarks in Paris were started during his reign: the Pont Neuf and the Place des Vosges.
In 2010 scientists found part of his embalmed head and used forensic tests to prove that it was his. It had been stolen from the tombs of the French kings and queens in Saint Denis in 1793 at the time of the French Revolution.
