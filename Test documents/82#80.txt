Clover.
Clover ("Trifolium") is a genus of about 300 species of plants in the pea family. It grows worldwide, mainly in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, but many species also in South America and Africa, including at high altitudes on mountains in the tropics.
They are small herbaceous plants. It has three sections to each leave, which looks like three leaves. This is called trifoliate.
