Barrel racing.
Barrel racing is an event often seen in rodeos. It involves a rider and horse going around 3 barrels in a cloverleaf pattern, started on either the right or the left side, but more often than not, the right side. Riders go from one barrel to the next making a circular pattern around each and then running back past the timer in want of the fastest time.
