Tourette syndrome.
Tourette syndrome is an inherited neurological disorder. Tourette syndrome can also be called "Tourette's syndrome","Tourette's disorder", "GTS", "Tourette's", or "TS". People that have Tourette's have tics (movements or sounds that the person cannot easily control). Tourette's is normally inherited, and starts in childhood.
People who have Tourette's have a normal life expectancy and normal intelligence. Tics are normally not as bad as people get older. Adults with severe Tourette's are rare. Fewer than 15% of people with Tourette's have coprolalia. Coprolalia is using words or phrases that some people might find offensive without being able to stop saying them. These may include curse words. However the stereotypical Tourette's sufferer has coprolalia.
Most people with Tourette's do not need treatment. There are drugs that can help people manage tics. There are also therapies that can help people live easier with Tourette's.
The disease is named after Georges Gilles de la Tourette. He was one of the first doctors to describe the symptoms.
