Tortilla.
A tortilla is a flat bread used in Mexican cuisine. They are used in burritos, enchiladas, and mainly as a wrap called taco. They are normally made of maize (corn), but can also be made of wheat or potatoes.
In Spanish cuisine, tortillas are very different; they are closer to an omelette based on potatoes.
