The team has won nine NFL Championships, with the last being in 1985 (Super Bowl XX). They also played in Super Bowl XLI in 2006 against the Indianapolis Colts, but they lost 29-17 to Peyton Manning.

The Bears play their home games at Soldier Field. They played there from 1974-2001 and then 2003-present (Soldier Field was being made new in 2002). The Bears had played at Wrigley Field from 1921-1970. Wrigley Field is the home of the Chicago Cubs baseball team, and the Bears were named after the Cubs.
