Atomic bombing.
At the time of the attack, Hiroshima was the headquarters of the 2nd General Army and 5th Division, containing 40,000 Japanese soldiers within the city's limit, and was a beehive of war industry, which manufactured parts for planes and boats, bombs, rifles, and handguns, where children were shown how to construct and hurl gasoline bombs and the wheelchair-bound and bedridden were assembling booby traps to be planted in the beaches of Kyushu. As with other Japanese cities, many of the strategic targets in Hiroshima were mixed with wooden and paper civilian homes and centers, which made it harder to conduct a successful precision attack, owing to the highly inaccuracy of the bombing technology in World War II. As a result, the city became the first nuclear weapon used against a target in history.
The bomb exploded over Hiroshima at 8:16 on the morning of August 6, 1945. Much of the city was destroyed. An estimated 70,000 persons, of whom 20,000 were Japanese soldiers and 20,000 were Korean slave laborers, were killed, and another 70,000 were injured. The bomb was nicknamed "Little Boy" after President Theodore Roosevelt. A building near the blast center still remains and is called the Atomic Bomb Dome.
Itsukushima shrine.
Near to Hiroshima, there is a small island called Miyajima. The island is known for its deer. An old Shinto shrine named Itsukushima Shrine is also here. It is said that Itsukushima shrine was built at the end of the 5th century. The shrine is known for its use of red-colored wood, and especially for the "torii" gate that leads into the shrine, which is partly underwater at high tide. Today Itsukushima shrine and the Atomic Bomb Dome are registered as World Heritage sites. Also it was a landing site for the U.S.
