Past tense.
Past tense is a verb form which is marked by time (tense).
The past tense is used for actions in a time which has already happened. In order to explain and understand past tense, it is useful to imagine time as a line on which the past, the present tense and the future tense are positioned.
Words in English have several tenses, including many common past tenses. The two that are used the most are the simple past tense and the perfect tense
Simple past tense.
One very irregular verb is "to read", which is the same when written down in the past tense, but pronounced differently. In the present tense, "read" is pronounced like the word "reed" or "seed", but in the past tense it is pronounced the same as "red". In the example below the spelling of the verb does not change, though the tense (and thus the pronunciation) does.
Perfect tense.
The Perfect is about "completion": actions which are completed. The tense refers to a period in the past. In English the Perfect is made by have + -ed or variations of that form.
Verb endings: -ed = finished; -ing = continuing
