Annie Hall.
"Annie Hall" is a 1977 American romantic comedy movie from United Artists. Woody Allen directed and stars in it. At first it was called "Anhedonia", then "It Had To Be Jew", but these titles would not sell the movie. "Annie Hall" has been considered a biography of Allen's real life, but the actor has denied this claim.
Plot.
The movie takes place in New York City and Los Angeles, California. It tells the story of Alvy Singer, a comedian from Brooklyn, who is interested in death. He has an affair with the title character (played by Diane Keaton), who loves life.
Alvy says his Brooklyn house was below a roller coaster on Coney Island. His father was the owner of a place that had bumper cars.
Techniques.
"Annie Hall" is noted for its use of special elements such as double exposure (two pictures in one) and magic themes in a real setting.
There is an animated scene with a cartoon version of Allen, and the Witch from Disney's "Snow White".
Academy Awards.
Allen was nominated for Best Actor.
The movie won one Golden Globe Award, for Best Actress in Musical or Comedy (Diane Keaton). It was nominated for three more: Best Motion Picture (Musical or Comedy), Best Director (Woody Allen), and Best Actor in Musical or Comedy (Woody Allen). The film also won the BAFTA Award for Best Film and the BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay.
Recognition.
It has been called one of the best comedy movies of all time. It has appeared on IMDb's Top 250 List, and was number thirty on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies list. In 1992, it was selected to keep in the United States National Film Registry.
Influence.
Many of today's romantic comedy movies have been influenced by "Annie Hall". The tie that was worn by Keaton's character was popular at the time of the movie's release.
Christopher Walken, who would later become more famous, had his first major role as the title character's brother.
