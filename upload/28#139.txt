Guyana.
The Co-operative Republic of Guyana is a country in South America. It is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world (seven hundred thousand people live there inside its over 200,000 km² of area). Georgetown is the capital; like most of the country's settlements, it is on a flat coastal plain that goes from northwest to southeast. Venezuela claims the land west of the Essequibo River as part of Guayana Esequiba.
Guyana's current president is Bharrat Jagdeo. The country gained independence from the United Kingdom on May 26, 1966 (before which it was called British Guiana).
Guyana is member of the Commonwealth of Nations. It is ranked first in suicides per capita worldwide.
