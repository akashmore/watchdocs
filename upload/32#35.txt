Well.
A well is a hole that is dug into the Earth to get water (or crude oil or natural gas). A qanat is an ancient complex water well system used in the Middle East. Wells can be as simple as a hole that a bucket on a rope can be lowered into, or very complex with pipes and high-powered pumps to get the water out. Most cities that are not close to fresh water lakes or rivers get their water from wells.
It is important to be careful what rubbish is put into the ground near a well. If something toxic is put in the ground, it could end up in the water from the well and make people sick.
Water is a problem for many African countries. Many charities are helping to build wells in local villages to help stop lengthy travel to distant water supply.
A well only works if underneath there is an aquifer which feeds it.
