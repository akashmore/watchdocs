List of communist parties.
There are a number of communist parties around the world. The first communist parties were set up after the Russian Revolution. Their aim was to support the Bolsheviks (the Russian communists).
In world history, the Russian and Chinese communists are very important.
In Western Europe, the French, Spanish and Italian communist parties are the biggest. They have taken part in either local, regional or central government in those countries.
Some communist parties have different names, such as Socialist Party, Socialist Workers Party, or Workers Party. But most socialist parties are social democratic and not communist.
