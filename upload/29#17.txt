Liberia.
The Republic of Liberia is a small country on the coast of West Africa. The country has been badly affected in recent years by two civil wars.
The name of the country is "Land of the Free" in Latin, because it was founded in the early 19th century by freed American slaves. It gained its independence on July 26, 1847. Its official language is English.
The President of Liberia is Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.
Liberia is the home of more than three million people. There are about 3,300,000 in Liberia. The capital city of Liberia is Monrovia.
The country's constitution is similar to that of the United States. In the Autumn 2005 elections, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf became the first female elected head of state in African history. She was inaugurated on January 16, 2006. The President before Johnson-Sirleaf was Gyude Bryant.
