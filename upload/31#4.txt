Prostate.
The prostate is a gland of the male body that adds part of the fluid to semen. A healthy human prostate is slightly larger than a walnut. It surrounds the urethra just below the urinary bladder.
Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting elderly men in developed (also known as first world) countries and a major cause of death. Regular rectal exams are recommended for older men to detect prostate cancer early.
The prostate is often referred to as the male G-spot, which is a spot inside the female vagina that causes intense pleasure when it is stimulated. The prostate can be massaged by using a finger or during anal sex. Some males are able to orgasm with prostate stimulation alone.
