Shit.
Shit is a slang term for feces. Shit is a swear word (an offensive, rude, or impolite word) to most English speakers.
It can also mean things other than feces, depending on the conversation. It can be used as an angry shout. It can sometimes be an adjective or verb. The term bullshit, a variant of the word shit, is a slang term that means nonsense.
