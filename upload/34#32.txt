BBC Radio 1.
BBC Radio 1 (often known as Radio 1) is an international radio station that is based in the United Kingdom. It is owned by BBC and BBC Radio. Radio 1 started broadcasting at 7.00 am on September 30, 1967. Tony Blackburn presented the first programme on the station.
Radio 1 mainly plays popular music throughout the day, and often plays alternative music genres after 7 pm. This includes electronic dance, rock or just interviews. The station is meant to be listened to mainly by people aged 15â€“29.
Before the launch of Radio 1, the BBC ran three radio stations (the BBC Light Programme, the BBC Home Service and the BBC Third Programme), but these were considered old fashioned and were closed down in 1967. They were replaced with Radio 1, 2, 3 and 4.
The launch of Radio 1 in 1967 was because of the popularity of pirate radio stations such as Radio Caroline. They had been outlawed by Act of Parliament, and the BBC needed to provide alternative radio stations.
Radio 1 also has a sister station, BBC Radio 1Xtra.
