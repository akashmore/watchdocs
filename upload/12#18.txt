Sphere.
A sphere is a shape in space that is like the surface of a ball. Most of the time, the terms ball and sphere are used as the same. But in mathematics, the precise (exact) definition only allows points in the 3 dimensional space which are uniformly and symmetrically located at a fixed length called radius of the sphere.
Examples of these are basketballs, superballs, and playground balls.
A sphere is the 3 dimensional analogue of a circle.
Volume.
The volume (V) of a sphere is given by the following formula
where "r" is the radius of the sphere.
Surface area.
The surface area (A) of a sphere is given by the following formula
where "r" is the radius of the sphere.
