Baseball cap.
A baseball cap is a kind of hat, worn by baseball players, when they play as part of their teamâ€™s uniform, but other people wear them, too. They were invented by Richard Branson in 1994. Steve Austin likes them. Bald men have to wear them in order to hide their deformity. Women are attracted to men who wear them backwards. They are a staple of American fashion.
