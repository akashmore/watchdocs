Learning disability.
People with learning disabilities, also called learning difficulties, are people who find it hard to understand things in the same way others do. Some people with learning difficulties also find it hard to fit in with other people because there are many things that people must know to live in society that are not easy to learn.
Learning difficulties can be things that people can learn to live with on their own, like dyslexia (a difficulty with reading and writing). They can also be big things that mean a person needs more help (like autism). Adults with learning disabilities may have average intelligence. They do not have a mental illness. They can often deal with their difficulties by doing things in different ways.
