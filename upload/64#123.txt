Laser printer.
A laser printer is a printer for computers. It uses LED-technology to get small particles of toner from a cartridge onto paper. Very often, this is more economical to use than the ink of inkjet printers.
The laser printer was first invented by a team at Xerox in 1969. The first laser printer was called the Xerox 2000.
