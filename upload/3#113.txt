Long Island.
Long Island is a large island in New York. It is the longest and largest island in the mainland United States. The island has four counties: Queens and Brooklyn in the west are boroughs of New York City, Nassau County is in the central area, and Suffolk County in the east. To the north is Long Island Sound and to the south is the Atlantic Ocean.
The East River separates Long Island from Manhattan island and the Bronx mainland. The island is a terminal moraine left by glaciers during the ice ages.
The 2000 census counted 7,448,618, people living on Long Island, making it the most populated island in all of the United States, and more populated than Ireland and Jamaica. Long Island is in the eastern time zone.
The term "Long Island" often refers only to the mostly suburban counties of Nassau and Suffolk because Brooklyn and Queens are part of New York City.
