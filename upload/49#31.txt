NAND gate.
The NAND gate is a logic gate used to build digital logic circuits. Given two inputs, A and B, A NAND B will be true if at most one of A and B is true. In other words, A NAND B is false if both A and B are true, and true otherwise. The NAND gate is a "universal gate."
Symbols.
There are three symbols for NAND gates: the 'military' symbol and the 'rectangular' symbol. For more information see logic gate symbols.
