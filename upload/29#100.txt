Ornithology.
Ornithology is the study of birds. A person who studies birds is called an ornithologist.
Several aspects of ornithology differ from other disciplines, because they are easy to see and are often attractive. Many studies of birds have been done by amateurs working in a scientific manner.
Konrad Gesner wrote his "Vogelbuch" and "Icones avium omnium" around 1557. Later, England developed a tradition of ornithology. Francis Willughby, John Ray, Gilbert White, John Gould (who studied the birds of Australia) and Peter Scott are good examples.
