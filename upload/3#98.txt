World War III.
World War III is the name given to a possible third world war. It refers to a futuristic world war that will be the successor to World War II (1939-1945).
A world war means a war that is fought by multiple countries of the world against each other, across different continents. Because technology and weapons have become so advanced, most people agree that if this war ever happens, nuclear, biological and chemical weapons will be used. "Nuclear weapons" get their energy from breaking or joining atoms. "Biological weapons" are living things, usually bacteria or viruses. "Chemical weapons" might not kill quickly, but poison people or their land. Together, nuclear, biological and chemical weapons are called Weapons of mass destruction. Conventional weapons on the other hand are "normal weapons", like guns or bombs.
Mass destruction could damage much of the Earth and kill most humans and many other living things. Albert Einstein said "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones." This shows that he believed that civilization as we know it would be gone.
Events that could have led to a third world war.
Several times, there have been events that could have led to a third world war. The Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 brought the world to the edge of a nuclear war, but this did not end up happening.
Actual events called World War III.
Some events, for example the Cold War, have been called "World War III". Former President of the United States George W. Bush compared the War on Terrorism to World War III.
