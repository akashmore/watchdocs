Robert Mugabe.
Robert Gabriel Mugabe (born 21 February 1924) is the President of Zimbabwe. He has been the president since 1987. Before that, he was Prime Minister, the head of government, after being elected in 1980. Especially in the last few years, Mugabe has ruled his country in the style of a dictator.
His first years as leader were prosperous. He introduced land reforms, which were supposed to give the land claimed by white people back to the (original) black owners. This has had a serious impact on how the country is seen from outside. In recent years, Mugabe has allowed violence against the white citizens of the country as well as to opposition leaders of all races. The reforms were done in 1998. In 2001, the United Nations imposed sanctions against Zimbabwe. This was done because human rights abuses came to the attention of the United Nations.
Now, people are unsure how the country can tackle its problems. Also, it is unclear what will happen after Mugabe dies. Mugabe has become increasingly unpopular in Zimbabwe and many in the country are now calling for his regime to end. He is currently the world's oldest head of state.
