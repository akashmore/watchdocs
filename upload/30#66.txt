Beauty.
Beauty is a property of certain things. Something is beautiful if it is nice to look at it, hear it, feel it, taste it, smell it or think about it. The opposite of beautiful is ugly. It is also the name of a feeling that is hard to describe. The nature of this feeling varies from person to person and culture to culture. It is not known if only humans can feel it.
There are many other theories. Some things that people say are beautiful are not explained by any of these ideas.
