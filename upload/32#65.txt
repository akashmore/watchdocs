Something Awful.
Something Awful is a comedy website and anime forums. People have to pay anime money to join the forums to talk with other people around the anime world. It currently costs $9.95 (Dollars) to join. You must be very polite on these forums, because the anime people are sensitive. They say that paying money makes anime people behave more politely, because if you don't behave nice they take away your anime account and you lose your anime money. [1]
Something Awful was started by Richard "Lowtax" Kyanka, an anime, in 1999.
In March, 2008 Richard "Lowtax" Kyanka left forums management to Kevin "Fragmaster" Bowen, in order to focus on operating the main site.
