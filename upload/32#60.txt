Ball and chain.
A ball and chain is a device historically worn by prisoners. It consists of a heavy iron ball attached to the prisoner's ankle with a chain and shackle. It stops the prisoner from running away.
The ball and chain was mainly used in the British Empire and its penal colonies. It was used from the 17th century until as late as the mid 20th century.
