Mechanical engineering.
Mechanical engineering is a branch of engineering that applies the principles of Mechanics and Materials science for analysis, design, manufacturing, and maintenance of mechanical systems. It involves the production and usage of heat and mechanical power for the design, production, and operation of machines and tools. They can vary from building a rocket ship all the way down to a modern car. It is one of the oldest and broadest engineering disciplines.
