Nationality.
The nationality of a person is that person's legal relationship with a state, for example a Swedish person's legal relationship with the kingdom of Sweden. Nationality is not identical to citizenship but in the majority of states most of the population are also citizens. Dual nationality means that the person has a legal relationship with two different states at the same time, for example the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. The rights and duties of individual people and the states they belong to vary from country to country.
