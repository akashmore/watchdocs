Trigonometry.
Trigonometry (from the Greek "trigonon" = three angles and "metron" = measure) is a part of elementary mathematics dealing with angles, triangles and trigonometric functions such as sine (abbreviated sin), cosine (abbreviated cos) and tangent (abbreviated tan). It has some connection to geometry, although there is disagreement on exactly what that connection is; for some, trigonometry is just a section of geometry.
Trigonometric ratios.
Cosecant (csc) - The cosecant of an angle is equal to the formula_4 or formula_5
Secant (sec) - The secant of an angle is equal to the formula_6 or formula_7
Cotangent (cot) - The cotangent of an angle is equal to the formula_8 or formula_9

Using trigonometry.
With the sines and cosines one can answer virtually all questions about triangles. This is called "solving" the triangle. One can work out the remaining angles and sides of any triangle as soon as two sides and their included angle or two angles and a side or three sides are known. These laws are useful in all branches of geometry, since "every polygon may be described as a combination of triangles".
Trigonometry is also vital in surveying, in vector analysis, and in the study of periodic functions.
There is also such a thing as spherical trigonometry, which deals with spherical geometry. This is used for calculations in astronomy, geodesy and navigation.
