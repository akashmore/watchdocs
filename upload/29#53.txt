Jonathan Ke Quan.
Jonathan Ke Quan (born August 20, 1971 as Ke Huy Quan) is a Vietnamese-American former child actor.
In the 1980s, he appeared in several movies. His best known roles were as Short Round in "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" (1984) and Data in "The Goonies" (1985). He now works as a stunt coordinator on many movies, for example "X-Men".
In Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, he was an orphan in the streets of Shanghai when he becomes Indy's(Harrison Ford) friend. They end up in India where Indy, Short Round and night club singer Willie Scott(Kate Capshaw) fight Indians, save children, and scream to death in a mine car chase. They go through a lot of things together, like a family. Yet, everyone must say good-bye someday
After their adventures in India Short Round had a nervous breakdown, he told Indy that he could no longer deal with the constant thought that death was right around every corner. Short Round told Indy that he was done and then he moved to Oregon where he used the masses of money he had attained gathering ancient artifacts to buy himself a new name "Data" and to hire two Vieatnamese refugees to pose as his parents.
He would later come to use his treasure hunting skills to find the forgotten fortune of a Mr. One Eyed Willy. Short round later grew weary of his humble life and craved adventure, he decided he no longer wanted to be a sidekick so he struck out on his own.
