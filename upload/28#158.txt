Al-Qaeda.
Al-Qaeda (, "al-qāʿidah", "the base"), is an armed Islamic group that was started between August 1988 and late 1989.p75 It works as a network, as a stateless army, and a radical Sunni Muslim movement calling for global Jihad. Most of the world thinks it is a Takfiri and terrorist organization.
Members of al-Qaeda have performed many acts of terrorism. Most of these have been done against the United States, and other liberal countries. Some of its most well-known attacks have been the September 11 attacks, the bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, and the attack on the US Navy ship USS Cole in 2000. Al-Qaeda has done suicide attacks and simultaneous (at the same time) bombings of different targets.
Among al-Qaeda's goals is for other countries to stop influencing Muslim countries, and for a new Islamic caliphate to be made. There have been reports that al-Qaeda believes that a Christian–Jewish alliance is conspiring to destroy Islam, (largely embodied in Israel–United States relations), and that the killing of bystanders and civilians is religiously justified in jihad.
There have been guesses that there are 500-1,000 operatives in Afghanistan and around 5,000 worldwide. However, there is no confirmation of this.
