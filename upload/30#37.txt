Andy Gibb.
Andy Gibb (March 5, 1958 â€“ March 10, 1988) was a British pop singer popular in the 1970s. He was the younger brother of Barry (born 1946), Maurice (1949-2003) and Robin Gibb (1949-2012), The Bee Gees. He was born in Manchester, but spent most of childhood in Queensland. He died in Oxford of myocarditis (a heart problem) caused by an infection, shortly after his 30th birthday. While his years of alcohol and cocaine abuse were not the direct cause of death, they certainly did not help his condition.
