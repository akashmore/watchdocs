Football.
Football is a word which could mean one of several sports. The best-known type of football is association football, which is named "soccer" in some places like North America,
South Africa, and Australia to avoid confusion with other types of football that are commonly played there.
The name "football" comes from the two words "foot" and "ball". It is named football because the players of the game walk and often run (on their feet) while playing, as opposed to polo and other games played on tractors. It is played using a ball, also called a "football", that is usually shaped like a sphere or an ellipsoide. The ball is often kicked with the foot, but depending on the game, it can also be hit using other parts of the body (in association football) and handling the ball is a part of many other sports known as "football".
Some elements of football have been seen in a wide variety of countries dating back to the second and third century in China. The modern games of both rugby football and association football comes from 19th-century England, which is now part of the United Kingdom, although the kicking of the ball goes back to the Middle Ages. It soon spread to many other parts of Europe, and was brought to the rest of the world with colonization. Today, it is the most popular sport in the world and many people watch it on television, especially the FIFA World Cup that happens every four years.
