Boolean algebra.
Boolean algebra is algebra for binary (0 means false and 1 means true). It uses normal maths symbols, but it does not work in the same way. It is named after its creator George Boole.
NOT gate.
It means the output is not the input.
AND gate.
The output is true only if one and the other input is true.
OR gate.
One or the other input can be true for the output to be true.
XOR gate.
XOR basically means "exclusive or", meaning one input or the other must be true, but not both.
To make it more simple, one or the other input must be true, but not both.
Identities.
It is not the same as a NOT then an AND like this: formula_20
which is called "XOR identity table"
formula_26.
or if formula_27=TRUE, TRUE.,
DeMorgan's laws.
"Make/break the bar and change the sign."
