Hibiscus syriacus.
"Hibiscus syriacus" is one of the common flowering shrubs found in gardens, a species of "Hibiscus". Common names for the same plant include Rose of Sharon (but it is not a rose), rose mallow, shrub-althaea, Syrian hibiscus, Syrian ketmia, and St Joseph's rod.
The part of the name "syriacus" seems to say that the origin of this plant is from Syria, but the exact origin is so far unknown. Historically it was grown in ancient China and then it became a popular plant in Korea. Today the flowers are national symbols of Korea. In Japan, the flowers are often shown at tea ceremonies for decoration.
There are many variations of flowers in gardens, because gardeners of the past were able to find different colors and shapes of flowers, and grow their seeds.
