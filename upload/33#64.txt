Stop-motion.
Stop motion is a way of animation which makes it look like still objects are moving. Clay animation is a good example of how stop motion is used.
Stop-motion requires any camera that can make single frames (or photos). It works by shooting a single frame, moving the object a little bit, and capturing a frame again. Cartoons use a similar way; one of the main differences is that stop motion uses real objects instead of drawn.
Tim Burton, Will Vinton and the Aardman studio have used this method in their productions.
