Monotheism.
Monotheism is the belief in only one god, rather than two or more, which would be polytheism such as Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, Ancient Egypt and partly Hinduism. Many religions are monotheistic, such as Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Baha'i Faith, Sikhism, Eckankar, Zoroastrianism, deism, Cao Dai and Tenrikyo. Zoroastrianism is thought to be among the oldest monotheistic religions.
