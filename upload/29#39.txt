Duane Eddy.
Duane Eddy (born April 26, 1938) was a Grammy Award-winning American rock guitarist. Many people enjoyed his music and tried to play the same way as he did. He is best known for the music that he played without singing words. He is probably best known for his hit song Rebel Rouser (1958).
