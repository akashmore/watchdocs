Anal sex.
Anal sex is a sex act performed on the anus. Anal sex can involve a penis inserted in the anus, oral stimulation of the anus, using fingers for penetration and using different objects for stimulation.
Overview.
The anus is a part of the body that is tight and cannot lubricate itself. Because of this, a person should be careful when inserting something without damaging the walls of this organ. Lubrication is often used which can be oil or water-based and is sold commercially.
For a man, pleasure can come from the stimulation of the prostate that is found near the anus. For women, it can come from indirect stimulation of the clitoral legs/G-Spot or the cervix. Both men and women can get pleasure from anal sex because the anus has a lot of nerve endings.
