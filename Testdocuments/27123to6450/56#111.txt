Hermann Minkowski.
Hermann Minkowski (22 June 1864 in Kaunas – 12 January 1909 in Göttingen) was a German mathematician of Jewish descent. He was one of Albert Einstein's teachers.
Minkowski is perhaps best known for his work in relativity, in which he showed in 1907 that his former student Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity (1905), could be understood geometrically as a theory of four-dimensional space-time, since known as the "Minkowski spacetime".
