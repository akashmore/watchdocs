Anne Redpath.
Anne Redpath (1895-1965) was a Scottish artist. She was born in Galashiels, Scotland.
She was the daughter of a tweed designer. Her father's work had an effect on her use of colour and texture in her paintings. "I do with a spot of red or yellow in a harmony of grey, what my father did in his tweed", she said.
