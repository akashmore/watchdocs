Second Punic War.
The Second Punic War was a war Hannibal and Scipio Africanus fought in 218 BC-202 BC. Hannibal was from Carthage. Scipio was from Rome. Hannibal had war elephants. Hannibal scared the Romans by invading them over the mountains, and kept winning battles by being a good general. No one else came to help Hannibal, even though he was doing well, so eventually Hannibal had to leave and go back to Carthage. Hannibal lost in the Battle of Zama, which was fought near the city of Carthage.
