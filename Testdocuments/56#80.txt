Europa (moon).
Europa is a large moon of the planet Jupiter. It is a little smaller than Earth's Moon and it is the sixth-largest moon in the solar system.
Europa's diameter is about 3000 kilometers. It probably has an iron core, and an atmosphere that's mostly oxygen. The surface is icy and very smooth. There are not a lot of craters, but there are some cracks and lines. Because the surface is so young and smooth, scientists believe that there is a liquid ocean under the surface, a so called ocean, and that it is kept warm by tidal heating. In other words, Jupiter's strong gravitational pull on Europa makes it warm.
The moon Europa was found by Simon Marius in December 1609. Galileo Galilei first saw the moon in January 1610 (he did not know Marius had found it). Simon Marius was the one who had the idea of the name 'Europa'.
The moon Europa is named after a princess from Greek mythology who became the first queen of Crete. However, people usually called Europa 'Jupiter II' till the middle of the 20th century.
Life on Europa.
There may be alien life in Europa's subsurface ocean, life similar to that of the Antarctic Lake Vostok or in Earth's deep oceans. There is no proof, but it is possible.
At least three things are necessary for life to develop - water, organic compounds, and heat. Europa has water and heat, and organic compounds can easily be found throughout the Solar System.
