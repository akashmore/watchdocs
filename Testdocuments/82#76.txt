Iraq War.
The Iraq War was an armed conflict that began in 2003 with the invasion of Iraq by a United States-led coalition that toppled the government of Saddam Hussein.
Background.
The conflict continued for much of the next ten years as an insurgency emerged to oppose the occupying forces and the post-invasion Iraqi government. An estimated 151,000 to 600,000 or more Iraqis were killed in the first 3â€“4 years of conflict. The United States officially withdrew from the country in 2011 but left private security contractors in its place to continue the war. It again became re-involved in 2014 at the head of a new coalition; the insurgency and many dimensions of the civil armed conflict continue.
Australia, the United Kingdom and Poland were also involved in the war with support from a military group in Iraq called Peshmerga and The Netherlands.
