Hick.
A hick is a term for an American stereotype. It is also used in Canada to a lesser degree. It is a term for people who live in rural areas, especially on farms and ranches. It is usually meant as an insult. One other form of the word 'hick' is 'redneck'. Others are yokel, hillbilly, and hayseed. The terms redneck hick and yokel, as well as others, are mostly used to describe people in the south-central United States, including Missouri, Arkansas, Georgia (to an extent) Illinois, Indiana, Ohio,Tennessee, Kentucky, Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska. This term is considered offensive to some.
