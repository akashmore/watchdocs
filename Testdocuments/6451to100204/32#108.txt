Titanium.
Titanium is a very strong metal. It is chemical element number 22 on the periodic table. Its symbol is "Ti". Titanium alloys are used in aerospace engineering to make very strong and light parts of airplanes. It does not corrode, not even in sea water and chlorine. However, it can burn at high temperatures, and titanium dust is extremely flammable. It has 22 electrons, 22 protons and 26 neutrons. Titanium was discovered in 1791 by William Gregor.
Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) is a white pigment (color) that is often used to make things less transparent. It is sometimes used in food.
