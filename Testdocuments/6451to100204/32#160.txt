Prefecture.
A prefecture is a word used by countries such as Greece and Japan (called "νομός", "nomós" in Greece and called 県 "ken" in Japan). It is a smaller part of a country with its own government. It is a kind of local government.
It is like an American state or a British county.
In France, it is the head of the department ("see" Prefectures in France "for more detail").
