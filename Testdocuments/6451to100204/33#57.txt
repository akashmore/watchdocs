Firefighter.
Firefighters or firemen are people whose job is to put out fires and rescue people. In a city, the building they work in is called a "fire station", or "fire hall". Firefighters work for the "fire department".
There are firefighters in cities and towns who fight fires in houses and other buildings. These are called "structural firefighters". There are also firefighters who fight wildfires away from towns.
In some places, they are also taught first aid and given medical training so they can help people in other ways. A paramedic or an emergency medical technician (EMT) are names for people who have first aid training and usually work on ambulances. Paramedics and EMTs in many places work for fire departments. Some work for other agencies such as ambulance companies or hospitals to ride on ambulances to transport sick and injured people. Fire engines sometimes go to medical emergencies if they are closer and can give first aid before the ambulance gets there. A fire truck usually carries the same equipment as an ambulance does. Search and rescue is also done by many fire departments.
Firefighters have vehicles they drive fires and rescue operations. If the vehicle pumps water it is called an "engine". If it does not pump water it is called a "truck". A rescue truck's main job is to responds to car wrecks, collapsed buildings, search and rescue, stuck elevators and other emergencies. If it carries the fire chief to fires, it is a fire chief car. Fire engines pump water and foam which is used to put out the fire. Fire trucks carry ladders and tools to help rescue people from burning buildings. Most engines carry first aid kits to help people who are injured or hurt.
Firefighters must wear heavy clothing which protects them from the heat when they are fighting a fire. This is called "bunker gear" or "turnout gear".
