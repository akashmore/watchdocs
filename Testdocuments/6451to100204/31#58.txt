Multiplayer video game.
Multiplayer is a term for games, usually video games, meaning more than one person can play it. It was popularized by newer gaming systems like Nintendo 64 that allowed four joysticks to be plugged into a home console unit for head-to-head play, competitive, or cooperative play.
