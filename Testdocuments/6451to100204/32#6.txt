Blind Faith.
Blind Faith was an English rock-blues band. The band was only together for about one year (1969). It was formed by Eric Clapton who had been in the band Cream. Also in the band were Ginger Baker (who was Cream's drummer) and Rick Grech (who was in the band "Family"). Clapton, Winwood, and many other people had high expectations for the new band, but many people did not like the new stuff they were doing. Many people wanted to hear music like Cream made. The name of the band came about as a result of the "blind faith" shown by many people. These people had thought that the band would go on to greatness. Many people did not like the band and they broke up. Before they broke up, they released a self-titled album. It caused controversy because it only had six songs and featured a naked teenage girl holding a toy airplane on the cover. This image upset some people.
