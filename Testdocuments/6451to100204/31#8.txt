H. P. Lovecraft.
Howard Phillips Lovecraft (August 20, 1890 â€“ March 15, 1937) was an American author of fantasy, horror and science fiction.
He wrote many scary short stories. These often were about odd creatures that Lovecraft made up by himself or with his friends, including August Derleth, who wrote mysteries. The creatures did not really care about human people at all, so they were not out to hurt people, but if they did, they did not care. They looked at us like we would be ants. Their behaviour, attitude and look also tended to make people go crazy.
Lovecraft's stories were inspiration for lots of other authors.The spirit of his works, presenting a world that does not care, is present in many works of fiction.
Lovecraft was born in Providence, Rhode Island. He died of cancer there.
