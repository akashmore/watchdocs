The Bronx.
The Bronx is the northern part of New York City, United States. The name came from Bronck's Farms, owned by a settler called Jonas Bronck. The Bronx River flows south out of Yonkers and Mount Vernon, New York, through the middle of The Bronx, and into Long Island Sound. The Bronx was once the southern part of Westchester County, New York. The New York Yankees baseball team plays there.
