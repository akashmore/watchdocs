Jana Gana Mana.
The lyrics are written below in the Roman alphabet.
English translation.
You are the ruler of the minds of all people,
Thy name rouses the hearts of Punjab, Sindh,
Of the Dravida,Orissa and Bengal;
It echoes in the hills of the Vindhyas and Himalayas,
mingles in the music of Yamuna Ganges and is
chanted by the waves of the Indian Sea.
They pray for thy blessings and sing thy praise.
The saving of all people waits in thy hand,
