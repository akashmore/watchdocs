Culture.
People from Botswana are called "Batswana". The population of Botswana is about 1.8 million. This is only 2.7 persons per kmÂ², a small number for a country of this size. This is because most of the country is desert and very dry.
Botswana has two official languages. One is English. The other is a local language called "Setswana" (also called "Tswana").
Botswana is a democracy. The people vote for their political leaders. Those leaders vote for the president. In 2008 Ian Khama became the current president of Botswana. President Khama won elections in 2009 and 2014.
Economy.
The economy of Botswana has been growing very fast since it became an independent country in 1966. The people of Botswana have had the world's fastest growth in standard of living since that time.
Botswana's economy comes mostly from mining. This includes diamonds, metals (including copper) and minerals (including salt). Botswana is the highest producer of diamonds by value in the world. In 1999, Botswana produced over 30 million carats (6,000 kg) of diamonds from the three Debswana mines. That is about 25% of worldwide production.
Tourism is also important to the country. Many people come to Botswana each year to see its wildlife.
The currency of Botswana is called the "pula" (which means rain). It is made up of 100 "thebe" (which means shield). In 2017, one US dollar is about 10.32 Pulas.
