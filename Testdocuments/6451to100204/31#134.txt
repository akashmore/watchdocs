Caucasian race.
Caucasian race (also known as Caucasoid) is a term used for a person belonging to a racial group that includes people from Europe, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, Western Asia (the Middle East), parts of Central Asia and South Asia. German anthropologists in the late 18th century applied this name because they thought people from the Caucasus Mountains were the best examples of the race. The term is not much used in anthropology anymore.
