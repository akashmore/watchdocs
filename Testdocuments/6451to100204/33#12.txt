George Carlin.
George Denis Patrick Carlin (May 12, 1937 â€“ June 22, 2008) was an American Stand-up comedian, writer, social critic, actor, author, comedian and satirist.
Carlin was born and raised in Manhattan, New York City. He was known for his "seven dirty words" routine. The routine was about seven words people shouldn't say in the media. (The list was ironically used by many radio stations, as a guide to what kind of language was not allowed.) Comedy Central called Carlin one of the greatest stand-up comedians.
Carlin acted in movies including "Jersey Girl", "Dogma", "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" (and its sequel), "Scary Movie 3", and Disney's "Tarzan 2". He also narrated the children's television series "Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends" from 1991 to 1995 (Actor Alec Baldwin later took over the role in 1998), and Portrayed Mr. Conductor on "Shining Time Station".
Carlin had a history of heart problems. He had several heart attacks. He died of heart failure in Santa Monica, California at age 71.
