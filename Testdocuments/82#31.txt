Amun.
In Egyptian mythology, Amun was a very powerful god. He was often combined with Ra to form the god Amun-Ra. At one point in Egyptian history, he was called the "King of the Gods".
Amun (also spelled Amon, Amoun, Amen, and sometimes Imen, "Egyptian" Yamanu) was the name of a deity, in Egyptian
mythology, who became one of the most important deities in Ancient Egypt. In later years, bined with Horus into one god.
Origin of name.
Amun's name is first recorded as "imn". That means "The hidden (one)". Vowels were not written in Egyptian hieroglyphics, but Egyptologists think the name must have been pronounced (yah-maa-nuh) originally. The name survives into the Coptic language as "Amoun."
Creator.
Amun was shown in human form, seated on a throne, wearing on his head a plain deep circlet from which rise two straight parallel plumes, maybe meant as had no father
When Amun had become more important than Menthu, the local war god of Thebes, Menthu was called the son of Amun. However, as Mut was infertile, it was believed that she, and thus Amun, had adopted Menthu instead.
