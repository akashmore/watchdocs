Vandalism.
Vandalism is a crime that is done by destroying or damaging the property of someone else. This can include graffiti and website damage.
A person that does this is called a vandal. The name comes from the Vandals, a tribe that attacked and damaged the city of Rome in 455 CE.
Examples.
Many websites, such as wikis (like Wikipedia), forums, and blogs, can be changed by anyone. Because of this, they can be "vandalized" by adding comments or replacing everything on the page with spam, nonsense or other silly content. It is a kind of trolling, and these websites have special users, called administrators, whose job is to remove the vandalism and to block users who do not stop vandalizing.
However, not all vandalism is bad. Some vandalism is to let people see their talent of art. The vandals do not have enough money to buy an art gallery and therefore using public property to allow people to admire their talent.
In the example of vandalism of modern prohibition also applies to this return Buddha of the South Korean government and theft of scriptures and Buddha from Tsushima by Korean thieves that occurred in October 2012 in a broad sense.
