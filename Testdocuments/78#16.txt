Anaerobic digestion.
Anaerobic digestion is the way microorganisms break down organic matter without oxygen. This process can happen naturally, but it is called anaerobic digestion only if it is supported and contained. An anaerobic digester is an industrial system that supports these natural process to treat waste, produce biogas that can be used to power electricity generators, provide heat and produce soil improving material.
