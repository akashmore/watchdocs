Nova Scotia.
Nova Scotia is a small province found on the east coast of Canada. The name "Nova Scotia" is Latin for "New Scotland". The capital and biggest city is Halifax.
People who live in Nova Scotia are called Nova Scotians. Right now, there are over 900,000 of them; many of whom do not live in large cities or towns, but villages, where few people live.
What is now called "Nova Scotia" used to be controlled by the Mik'maq Indians. The French settled among them at Port Royal after 1600, and called the land part of Acadia, with Port Royal as its capital. In 1710, after a war, the British captured Port Royal and went on to capture the rest of the peninsula. It was the first time that the British had captured and held a French colony.
Nova Scotia's government is a democracy. Stephen McNeil is the premier and John James Grant is the lieutenant governor.
