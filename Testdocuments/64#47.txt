Paramaribo.
Paramaribo (, nickname: Par′bo) is the capital city of Suriname. About 250.000 people live in the city. It is at the Suriname River about 15 km before the river flows into the Atlantic Ocean.
Paramirbo used to be called in French "Bourg nommé des Juifs" because so many Jewish people lived there.
