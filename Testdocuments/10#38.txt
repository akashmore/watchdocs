Census.
A census means getting information about every member of a population. It is usually used meaning a population of people, but can be used to mean a population of animals.
Both the United States and United Kingdom have a census every 10 years, or decade. But in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, all of which have a lot of immigrants in their population, they do it every 5 years.
